# Applying Machine Learning to predict the lifetime of Li-Ion Batteries
The project aims to build machine learning models that can accurately predict lithium-ion batteries' lifetime. We used a publicly available dataset to develop accurate and easily interpretable models. Using discharge voltage curves from early-stage cycles that have yet to undergo degradation, we have applied Random Forest, AdaBoost, ElasticNet, and Artificial Neural Network algorithms to predict cycle life. 
With each model, we have attempted to draw out as high accuracy as possible and have seen impressive accuracy in the Artificial Neural Network Model (ANN). Our model can quantitatively predict cycle life using the first 100 cycles with an accuracy of 75-85%. 
Our model ensures the reliable operation of lithium-ion batteries and contributes to accelerated technology development. Accurate prediction of a lifetime using early-cycle data would unlock new opportunities in battery production, use, and optimization. For example, manufacturers can accelerate the cell development cycle, perform rapid validation of new manufacturing processes, and sort/ grade new cells by their expected lifetime.
